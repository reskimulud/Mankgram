**Mankgram** is an Android application for sharing stories especially for developers. Mankgrams are created using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) programming language and built in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

**Mankgram** has a *simple interface and is easy to use*, you can send pictures either from the camera directly or take pictures from the gallery. There is also a feature to change the display mode to dark to make the user comfortable and of course it will save battery because it doesn't display a lot of light colors.

**Mankgram** are available in the form of a *list* and *map view* in displaying stories. To embed a location, we can tick **share location** when uploading a new story. In map view mode, we can change the map **type** and **style** as we like.

This application is an application that was made as an assignment for submission in the [Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Android Intermediate](https://dicoding.com/academies/352) class at [Dicoding](https://dicoding.com) learning platform, and it is also related to the [Bangkit Academy 2022](https://g.co/bangkit) activity that I participated in.
